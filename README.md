# Instructions
- The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.
- The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. - The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
- Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
- Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
